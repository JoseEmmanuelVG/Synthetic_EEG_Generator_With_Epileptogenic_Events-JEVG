# Synthetic EEG Signal Generator of Morphologies Associated with Epileptogenic Events

## Overview
This repository hosts the landing page for the Synthetic EEG Signal Generator of Morphologies Associated with Epileptogenic Events project. The landing page serves as the central hub for accessing different versions of the synthetic EEG signal generator, exploring related articles, and learning more about the project.

## Sections of the Website

### Home
The home section introduces the project with a background image visualizing synthetic EEG signals. The title "Synthetic EEG Signal Generator of Morphologies Associated with Epileptogenic Events" sets the focus of the project.

### About
The "About" section provides a detailed explanation of the project‚Äôs methodology. It describes how the tool generates synthetic EEG signals, simulates frequency bands, incorporates noise, and emulates specific phenomena.

- The tool, built using Python, allows for controlled signal generation, export in various formats, and features a visualizer for analyzing signals uploaded in TXT, CSV, or EDF formats.
- The accuracy and consistency of the generated signals have been validated using EEGLAB, supporting research, diagnosis, and data analysis models, especially in the field of neurological diseases like epilepsy.

### Portfolio
This section is divided into two parts: Software Versions and Articles.

- **Software Versions:**
  - **V1: Generador de EEG Sint√©tico con Eventos Epileptog√©nicos / Synthetic EEG Generator with Epileptogenic Events** - The first version of the software, accessible via a direct link.
  - **V2:** This upcoming version will introduce new features such as acute morphology and a visualizer for EEG files in TXT, CSV, and EDF formats. It is currently in the process of being hosted.

- **Articles:**
  - **CORE 2023:** Placeholder for the link to the CORE 2023 article.
  - **CCE 2024:** Placeholder for the link to the CCE 2024 article.

### Contact
The contact section includes links to the project‚Äôs GitHub repository, LinkedIn profile, and other social media platforms.

## Key Visual Elements
- **Background Image:** A visualization of synthetic EEG signals sets the tone for the project's technical focus.
- **EEG Signal Comparison:** This visual comparison highlights the differences between a real EEG signal and a synthetic one generated by the tool, referencing a prominent source in the field:
  - **Source:** E. Niedermeyer and F.L. da Silva, *Electroencephalography: Basic Principles, Clinical Applications, and Related Fields*, 5th ed. Baltimore, MD, USA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005.
